# üóí‚õè `notemine_hw` ‚ö°‚öôÔ∏è

This is a fork of [`notemine`](https://github.com/sandwichfarm/notemine).

`notemine_hw` is a rust-based tool for mining [nostr](https://nostr.com) notes.

While its parent project compiles to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) and caters for a web-native experience,
`notemine_hw` aims to leverage hardware acceleration for mining notes.

The UI is CLI-based, allowing for:
- Configurable PoW difficulty.
- Realtime hashrate logging.
- Events to be mined are provided as JSON files.
